tip RTFM

[1][Jargon]: RTFM

RTFM: /R·T·F·M/, imp.
 [Unix] Abbreviation for ‘Read The Fucking Manual’.

 1. Used by gurus to brush off questions they
   consider trivial or annoying.  Compare
   Don't do that then!.
 2. Used when reporting a problem to indicate that you aren't just
   asking out of randomness.  “No, I can't figure
   out how to interface Unix to my toaster, and yes, I have RTFM.”
   Unlike sense 1, this use is considered polite.  See also
   FM, RTFAQ,
   RTFB, RTFS,
   STFW, RTM, all of which
   mutated from RTFM, and compare UTSL.
